*Major WIP in terms of looks, I'm clearly not a designer haha

## How to make your own:

Hack club has an amazing guide! ▶️ https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card

Upload the files in this repo to any PCB and schematic editor. I've gone with EasyEDA. Personalize it with your own contact details and designs. Have fun and share yourself to the world!
